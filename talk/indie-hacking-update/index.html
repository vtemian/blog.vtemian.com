After 15 years of building production code, being CTO at QED (acquired by The Sandbox), and working with companies like Gorgias, I had one clear lesson: <strong>product drives value, not technical implementation</strong>.</p><p>So I started a side project. Something I could build and ship fast. Something that solves a real problem.</p><h2 id=the-side-project-sisifai>The Side Project: Sisif.ai</h2><p><strong><a href=https://sisif.ai>sisif.ai</a></strong> is an AI video generation API. Text prompt in, video out. Simple.</p><p><img src=sisif-scroll.gif alt="Sisif.ai demo"></p><p>Most AI video tools are built for clicking around in browsers. But developers want to automate — batch generation, workflow integration, programmatic control. That&rsquo;s the gap I saw.</p><p>Three steps: submit a text prompt, receive a webhook when it&rsquo;s done, download your video. Multiple resolutions. Pay per use, no subscription required.</p><p>I started building in December 2024 and launched in early 2025. Built it with <strong>SaaS Pegasus</strong>, a Django boilerplate by Cory Zue — who&rsquo;s been building in public since 2017 and runs at a $122/hour effective rate. No AI coding agents for this one. Just good old Django.</p><h2 id=the-marketing-playbook-that-didnt-work>The Marketing Playbook (That Didn&rsquo;t Work)</h2><p>I did everything the indie hacking playbook says:</p><ul><li><strong>Twitter/X content</strong> — posted regularly, shared progress</li><li><strong>ProductHunt launch</strong> — prepared the launch, gathered supporters</li><li><strong>SEO</strong> — added llms.txt, optimized pages</li><li><strong>Building in public</strong> — shared the journey</li></ul><p>The result?</p><ul><li><strong>0</strong> paying customers</li><li><strong>8</strong> followers</li><li>ProductHunt: crickets</li><li>SEO: too early to tell</li></ul><h3 id=two-months-of-twitter-a-reality-check>Two Months of Twitter: A Reality Check</h3><p>I committed to <strong>two months of consistent Twitter posting</strong>. Daily updates. Progress screenshots. Building in public threads. Engagement with other indie hackers. The kind of content that supposedly builds audiences.</p><p>After 60 days: <strong>8 followers</strong>. Not 8,000. Eight. Most of them were bots or other indie hackers doing the same thing. Zero customers came from Twitter. Zero meaningful conversations. Zero inbound interest.</p><p>The accounts that &ldquo;blow up&rdquo; on Twitter? They either got lucky with timing, had an existing audience from somewhere else, or have been grinding for years. There&rsquo;s no shortcut. And for a solo founder with a product to ship, spending 2+ hours daily on tweets that reach nobody is a terrible ROI.</p><h3 id=the-producthunt-launch-that-wasnt>The ProductHunt Launch That Wasn&rsquo;t</h3><p>I prepared a proper ProductHunt launch. Lined up supporters. Created assets. Picked a launch day. Did everything the guides recommend.</p><p>Launch day came. And&mldr; nothing. No traction. No upvotes from strangers. The supporters I gathered weren&rsquo;t enough to break through. ProductHunt&rsquo;s algorithm buried the launch before it had a chance.</p><p>Here&rsquo;s what I learned: <strong>ProductHunt is a lottery</strong>. The winners are either products with existing audiences (who bring their own traffic) or products that get lucky with the algorithm. For a new product from an unknown founder? The odds are stacked against you.</p><p>The harsh reality of indie hacking. Traditional marketing is slow. Twitter takes years to build. ProductHunt is a lottery. SEO needs months to compound.</p><h2 id=the-pivot-ride-existing-waves>The Pivot: Ride Existing Waves</h2><p>I stopped building from scratch. Instead, I asked: <strong>where are the users already?</strong></p><p>The answer was <strong>n8n</strong> — the workflow automation tool. Thousands of users building automations, looking for integrations. They don&rsquo;t need to find me. I need to be where they already are.</p><h3 id=the-n8n-strategy>The n8n Strategy</h3><p>I published <strong>2 workflow templates</strong> on the n8n creator hub:</p><ol><li><strong>TikTok video creation pipeline</strong> — GPT-4o-mini generates the script, Sisif.ai creates the video, posts automatically</li><li><strong>Instagram Reels automation</strong> — same stack, different output format</li></ol><p><img src=n8n-tiktok-workflow.png alt="n8n TikTok workflow"></p><p>The results? <strong>15,000 views</strong> on the TikTok template. <strong>4,000 views</strong> on the Instagram one. That&rsquo;s <strong>19,000 eyeballs</strong> on my product — more than I&rsquo;d get from years of tweeting.</p><p>These aren&rsquo;t vanity metrics. n8n users are exactly my target audience: developers and technical founders who want to automate video creation. They&rsquo;re already in a buying mindset — they&rsquo;re looking for tools to plug into their workflows.</p><p>The conversion funnel is simple: user discovers template → tries it → needs API access → signs up for Sisif.ai. No cold outreach. No content calendar. No algorithm to game.</p><h3 id=why-this-works>Why This Works</h3><p>This is <strong>riding existing waves</strong>. Instead of building an audience from zero, you tap into platforms where your users already hang out:</p><ul><li><strong>n8n</strong> has thousands of users searching for workflow integrations</li><li><strong>Zapier</strong> and <strong>Make</strong> have similar marketplaces</li><li><strong>GitHub</strong> templates get discovered organically</li></ul><p>SEO? Write for big sites that already rank. Distribution? Let users find you through tools they already use. The math is simple: it&rsquo;s easier to capture 0.1% of 100,000 users than to build 100 users from scratch.</p><h2 id=pricing-evolution>Pricing Evolution</h2><p>My first pricing was wrong. <strong>$9/month</strong> single plan. Too cheap, wrong incentives.</p><p>I switched to tiered pricing:</p><ul><li><strong>Alpha Tester</strong>: $10/month (100 tokens)</li><li><strong>Starter Pack</strong>: $50/month (1,000 tokens)</li><li><strong>Pro Creator</strong>: $200/month (5,000 tokens)</li></ul><p>Higher tiers = higher revenue per customer. The change increased MRR 4x.</p><p><img src=revenue-chart.png alt="Revenue growth"></p><h2 id=lessons-learned>Lessons Learned</h2><p>After months of building and marketing sisif.ai, here&rsquo;s what stuck:</p><p><strong>Distribution beats product.</strong> Build where users already are. The best product nobody knows about loses to the mediocre product everyone finds.</p><p><strong>Ride existing waves.</strong> n8n, marketplaces, integrations. Don&rsquo;t fight for attention. Go where attention already exists.</p><p><strong>Price for value.</strong> Tiered pricing forces you to think about customer segments. Not everyone needs the same thing. Charge accordingly.</p><p><strong>Traditional marketing is slow.</strong> Twitter/ProductHunt/SEO didn&rsquo;t work yet. Maybe they will. But I needed results now. Existing platforms delivered.</p><hr><p>Find me at <a href=https://twitter.com/vtemian>@vtemian</a> or check out <a href=https://sisif.ai>sisif.ai</a>.</p></div></article><footer class="flex justify-between text-xs text-link"><span>&copy; 2026 <a href=https://github.com/vtemian>Vlad Temian</a></span>
