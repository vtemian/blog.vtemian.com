      <description>I’m really nervous, only thinking of them. I had only one or two real interviews and conducted a few. Usually, I’m pretty lucky when it comes to job finding. The companies I like or want to work with contacted me, and it’s really flattering. No interview, just a small discussion, a beer and I’ll start next Monday.
For the past 2.5 years, I’ve started practicing. Practicing maybe it’s too much. I bought the books (like everybody does: Cracking the Coding Interview, The Algorithm Design Manual and Elements of Programming Interviews), paid a monthly subscription to leetcode.</description>

      <description>So here I am, me, naked, starting a blog.
I must admit, I’m shy and I don’t have any courage. I’ve always been this way. I lack the courage to make decisions, to commit, to trust myself. I’ve always wondered if people will accept me and I’ve tried my best to please and impress people.
This led to a stagnation stage. I was too afraid of trying new things, learning, experimenting, trusting.</description>
