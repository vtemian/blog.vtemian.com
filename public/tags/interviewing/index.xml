      <description>&lt;p&gt;I’m really nervous, only thinking of them. I had only one or two real interviews and conducted a few. Usually, I’m pretty lucky when it comes to job finding. The companies I like or want to work with contacted me, and it’s really flattering. No interview, just a small discussion, a beer and I’ll start next Monday.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1535515384173-d74166f26820?ixlib=rb-1.2.1&amp;amp;ixid=eyJhcHBfaWQiOjEyMDd9&amp;amp;auto=format&amp;amp;fit=crop&amp;amp;w=1350&amp;amp;q=80&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For the past 2.5 years, I’ve started practicing. Practicing maybe it’s too much. I bought the books (like everybody does: &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.amazon.com/0984782850-983056789626-Cracking-Coding-Interview/dp/B07F16D3BG/ref=pd_lpo_sbs_14_t_1?_encoding=UTF8&amp;amp;psc=1&amp;amp;refRID=RD27GF1B4JP3R14XH98M&#34;&gt;Cracking the Coding Interview&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.amazon.com/Algorithm-Design-Manual-Steven-Skiena/dp/1849967202/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;qid=1546546500&amp;amp;sr=8-2&amp;amp;keywords=Algorithm+Design&#34;&gt;The Algorithm Design Manual&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.amazon.com/Elements-Programming-Interviews-Questions-Tsung-Hsien/dp/B00C7F0V3W/ref=sr_1_6?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;qid=1546546537&amp;amp;sr=8-6&amp;amp;keywords=elements+of+Programming+Interviews&#34;&gt;Elements of Programming Interviews&lt;/a&gt;), paid a monthly subscription to leetcode.com, did some problems out there and that was it. I even told all my friends, and they all supported me. But each time I discovered a hard problem or did a mock interview that went bad, I would really feel ashamed and stopped trying. I would procrastinate and find other things to do (like finishing other work-related tasks or start a side-project in a new language etc.).&#xA;I wanted to feel safe and comfortable. I felt stupid that I didn’t know how to solve that problem, but I felt smart that I’ve could complete this extra task or did something pointless in a new programming language.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
