Everyone has a story about how AI helped them learn something. "I asked ChatGPT to explain monads and it finally clicked." Cool. But where's the actual session? Where's the messy back-and-forth where you got confused, the AI corrected you, and you iterated until understanding emerged?

Most AI-assisted learning stories are sanitized after the fact. You get the polished takeaway, not the process. The repo is called [vibe-infer](https://github.com/vtemian/vibe-infer) and that's intentional irony, because what happened here is the opposite of vibe coding. I wrote every line of GPU code. The AI was my tutor, not my ghostwriter.

This article shows the receipts. 155 messages, captured in full, from zero WebGPU knowledge to a working MNIST classifier running compute shaders in the browser.
