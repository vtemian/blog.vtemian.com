I build open-source tools that make agentic programming reliable and accessible. The common thread: AI agents are powerful but undisciplined. They lose context, skip planning, and produce work nobody reviewed. These projects add structure, memory, and visibility to how developers work with AI agents.

Most are [OpenCode](https://opencode.ai) plugins. All are MIT licensed.
