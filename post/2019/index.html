I’ve always been this way. I lack the courage to make decisions, to commit, to trust myself. I’ve always wondered if people will accept me and I’ve tried my best to please and impress people.</p><p>This led to a stagnation stage. I was too afraid of trying new things, learning, experimenting, trusting. I was, and I still am <strong>afraid of failing</strong>. What my friends will think of me if I say something stupid? What will happen if I’ll say something wrong during a presentation? What if I’ll ask a foolish question, during a presentation? What will the interviewer think if I say or do something wrong? What my friends/parents will think of me if I fail this interview? Why did that driver honk me? Did I make something wrong? What&hellip;if&hellip;something&hellip;stupid?</p><p>It’s easier to hide, to build a <strong>comfortable space</strong> and to stay there. It’s easier to feel safe and to avoid the harsh truth about yourself. I’m not <em>smart</em>. I’m not the <em>wonder kid I used to think I was</em>. I’m not <em>athletic</em>. I’m not a <em>leader</em>. I’m not <em>funny</em>. I’m not a <em>good friend</em>. I’m not the best <em>boyfriend</em>.</p><p>With this realization, I want to start 2019. My motto this year will be to <strong>“live uncomfortably”</strong>. I’m not what I thought I was, but that’s ok. It’s normal <em>not always to be the best and the most</em>&hellip;. But that doesn’t mean that I can’t overcome my fears and to live a more <strong>peaceful life</strong>.</p><p>That’s why this year I want to <strong>live uncomfortably</strong>. I want to start doing the things <strong>I was afraid of</strong>. I want to understand me better and to expose myself to the world. To internalized that <strong>it is normal and ok to fail</strong>. It’s ok to be <em>sad</em>, <em>disappointment</em>, <em>jealous</em>, <em>slow</em> or <em>stupid</em>.</p><p>And this is the first step. Exposing myself to the Internet. To the people that I know or don’t know. <strong>Hello!</strong></p></p></article></main><footer class=footer>&copy; 2019 <a href=https://github.com/vtemian>Vlad Temian</a>,
