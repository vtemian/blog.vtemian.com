[SLIDE 1 - Title]
Hey everyone, I'm Vlad Temian. Welcome to Indie TM number two.

---

[SLIDE 2 - About Me]
Quick intro: 15 years building production code. Former CTO at QED builders, acquired by The Sandbox. I love building, and I love people who love building.

---

[SLIDE 3 - Background: Communities]
I've been building communities for a while. Started with Python, moved to Web3, and now Agentic TM — focused on agentic programming.

---

[SLIDE 4 - Background: Gorgias]
Working with Gorgias taught me something important: product drives value, not technical implementation.

---

[SLIDE 5 - Background: QED]
I co-founded QED with about 20 people. We sold the company in late 2024.

---

[SLIDE 6 - The Side Project]
Now I'm working on a side project: sisif.ai — an AI video generation API.

---

[SLIDE 7 - What is Sisif]
It's simple: text prompt in, video out. Send a request to the API, get your video in 2 to 5 minutes.

---

[SLIDE 8 - Why an API]
Most AI video tools are built for clicking around in browsers. But developers want to automate — batch generation, workflow integration, programmatic control.

---

[SLIDE 9 - How It Works]
Three steps: submit a text prompt, receive a webhook when it's done, download your video. Multiple resolutions available.

---

[SLIDE 10 - Target Users]
Who's it for? Content creators scaling production. Developers building video features. Businesses automating marketing.

---

[SLIDE 11 - Pricing]
Pay per use, no subscription. 35 free credits to start. No credit card required.

---

[SLIDE 12 - CTA]

[SLIDE 13 - Thanks]
