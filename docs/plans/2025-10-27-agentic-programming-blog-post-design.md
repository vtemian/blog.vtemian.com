# Blog Post Design: Agentic Programming Reality Check

**Date**: 2025-10-27
**Author**: Vlad Temian
**Purpose**: Practitioner-focused blog post sharing real experiences with agentic programming to provide reality-check vs. AI hype

## Overview

This blog post will tell an inspiring story about using agentic programming to tackle technical debt in a SaaS application with surprisingly low effort. The post targets practitioners and aims to provide a reality-check on what actually works versus the hype around AI tools.

### Key Characteristics
- **Audience**: Other practitioners (peer-to-peer knowledge sharing)
- **Focus**: Reality-check on AI hype through real case study
- **Tone**: Balanced (credible technical detail but story-driven)
- **Core Story**: How agentic programming improved a SaaS full of technical debt with low effort
- **No constraints**: Length, confidentiality, or timeline limitations

## Structure

### Story First, Myths Revealed Approach
Lead with the inspiring journey of tackling technical debt, building narrative momentum and showing surprising low-effort wins. End by explicitly naming which myths the experience disproves.

## Content Sections

### 1. Opening Hook
Start with a relatable practitioner moment that draws readers in:
- The feeling of staring at legacy SaaS codebase full of technical debt
- Knowing modernization is needed but dreading the effort
- OR the moment of deciding to try agentic programming despite skepticism

**Goal**: Create immediate connection with reader's own experiences

### 2. Setup (1-2 paragraphs)
Paint the scene of the SaaS situation:
- What the SaaS was
- What kind of technical debt existed (outdated dependencies, poor architecture, test coverage gaps, etc.)
- The emotional reality: why this felt overwhelming before starting
- Keep it relatable - avoid making it sound unique to this specific situation

**Goal**: Establish the challenge in terms other practitioners recognize

### 3. Decision Point (1 paragraph)
Explain what triggered the attempt at agentic programming:
- Presentation prep? Deadline pressure? Curiosity?
- Include skepticism/uncertainty if present
- Practitioners trust honest doubt more than evangelism

**Goal**: Show authentic decision-making process

### 4. The Journey (3-5 story beats)
Each beat follows: Challenge → Agentic Approach → Surprising Outcome

For each beat, include:
- What tool/agent was used
- What it was asked to do (general approach, not full prompts unless particularly instructive)
- What happened that was surprising (speed? quality? caught something human missed?)
- One concrete technical example per beat to maintain credibility

**Goal**: Show the actual work process with enough detail to be believable and useful

### 5. The Revelation (1-2 paragraphs)
The moment of realization that this was working with far less effort than expected:
- Quantify if possible: "Expected 2 weeks, took 3 days" or "Upgraded 15 dependencies with 2 hours of oversight"
- Capture the surprise/shift in perspective

**Goal**: The emotional and practical "aha" moment

### 6. Results (1 paragraph)
Concrete outcomes:
- What tangibly improved in the codebase
- Effort invested vs. traditional estimate
- What still needed human judgment/intervention (important for credibility)

**Goal**: Provide measurable evidence without overstating

### 7. Myth-Busting Section (3-4 short subsections)
Each myth addressed with this pattern:
- **The Hype Says**: State the myth (1 sentence)
- **My Reality**: Counter with actual experience (2-3 sentences referencing specific story moments)

Potential myths (to be identified from presentation slides):
- "AI agents replace developers" → Reality: They're productivity multipliers, not replacements
- "You need perfect prompts" → Reality: Iterative conversation works better
- "It works out of the box" → Reality: Domain knowledge needed to validate and guide
- "Technical debt is too complex for AI" → Reality: Depends on the type

**Goal**: Explicitly contrast hype with reality using the story as evidence

### 8. Closing (2 paragraphs)
- **Takeaway for practitioners**: Where agentic programming actually delivers value vs. where it doesn't
- **Call to reality**: Not "use AI for everything" but "here's a legitimate use case with real ROI"

**Goal**: Leave readers with practical, honest assessment

### Optional Elements
- Pull quotes from the experience to break up text
- Simple before/after comparison (metrics or qualitative)
- Link to presentation slides if comfortable sharing

## Next Steps

1. Review presentation slides to extract:
   - Specific technical details for story beats
   - Actual metrics/outcomes
   - Exact myths addressed in presentation
   - Any visuals or examples to adapt for blog

2. Draft the blog post following this structure

3. Create new Markdown file in `content/post/` with YAML frontmatter per Hugo requirements
