&lt;p>I must admit, I’m shy and I don’t have any &lt;strong>courage&lt;/strong>. I’ve always been this way. I lack the courage to make decisions, to commit, to trust myself. I’ve always wondered if people will accept me and I’ve tried my best to please and impress people.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This led to a stagnation stage. I was too afraid of trying new things, learning, experimenting, trusting. I was, and I still am &lt;strong>afraid of failing&lt;/strong>. What my friends will think of me if I say something stupid? What will happen if I’ll say something wrong during a presentation? What if I’ll ask a foolish question, during a presentation? What will the interviewer think if I say or do something wrong? What my friends/parents will think of me if I fail this interview? Why did that driver honk me? Did I make something wrong? What&amp;hellip;if&amp;hellip;something&amp;hellip;stupid?&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
