My regular work was done for the day. I had three hours before I needed to stop.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A friend had recommended Claude Code a few days earlier. &amp;ldquo;Think of it like having a really junior developer on your team.&amp;rdquo; I was skeptical. I&amp;rsquo;d used Copilot for autocomplete, played with ChatGPT. Wasn&amp;rsquo;t sold on Cursor.&lt;/p>

For the majority of the time, it stays in silence and it&amp;rsquo;s doing its job, without complaining.
But, there are these creatures, humanoid, that from time to time, will change it. Will try to fix it, adapt, or
completely remove parts of it. Those creatures tend to conserve energy and they are using pattern recognition to do so.
They observe patterns and take fast and easy decisions based on those patterns.
Because of that, this code entity needs to be structured and behave in certain patterns.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
