One exciting development is &lt;a href="https://www.recvc.com/part-i-design-space-for-parallel-blockchains/">parallel blockchains&lt;/a>, specifically those that execute a batch of transactions in parallel.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="concurrency-at-scale">Concurrency at Scale&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>When studying those chains, you can see some parallels to classical &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concurrency_control">concurrency patterns&lt;/a>, but those are hard to implement at scale.
Why is that? In addition to executing transactions in parallel (happening at the VM layer), we also need to consider replicating their output across the network.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
