After 15 years of building production code, being CTO at QED (acquired by The Sandbox), and working with companies like Gorgias, I had one clear lesson: &lt;strong>product drives value, not technical implementation&lt;/strong>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So I started a side project. Something I could build and ship fast. Something that solves a real problem.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="the-side-project-sisifai">The Side Project: Sisif.ai&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>&lt;a href="https://sisif.ai">sisif.ai&lt;/a>&lt;/strong> is an AI video generation API. Text prompt in, video out. Simple.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Technical Debt is Cheap</title><link>https://blog.vtemian.com/talk/technical-debt-is-cheap/</link><pubDate>Mon, 27 Oct 2025 10:00:00 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://blog.vtemian.com/talk/technical-debt-is-cheap/</guid><description>&lt;p>March 17th, 2025. My regular work was done for the day. I had three hours before I needed to stop.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A friend had recommended Claude Code a few days earlier. &amp;ldquo;Think of it like having a really junior developer on your team.&amp;rdquo; I was skeptical. I&amp;rsquo;d used Copilot for autocomplete, played with ChatGPT. Wasn&amp;rsquo;t sold on Cursor.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>But I had this project. The one everyone has. Making money for years, users depend on it, and every time someone opens the codebase they quietly close their laptop and find something else to do.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
