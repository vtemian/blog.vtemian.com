But where&amp;rsquo;s the actual session? Where&amp;rsquo;s the messy back-and-forth where you got confused, the AI corrected you, and you iterated until understanding emerged?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Most AI-assisted learning stories are sanitized after the fact. You get the polished takeaway, not the process. The repo is called &lt;a href="https://github.com/vtemian/vibe-infer">vibe-infer&lt;/a> and that&amp;rsquo;s intentional irony, because what happened here is the opposite of vibe coding. I wrote every line of GPU code. The AI was my tutor, not my ghostwriter.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
