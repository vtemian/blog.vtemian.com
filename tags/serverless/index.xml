Let&amp;rsquo;s say that we have a simple Django application, &lt;a href="https://github.com/vtemian/simple-django-app">poll&amp;rsquo;s app&lt;/a> from the tutorial. It runs perfect on our local machine, we added a requirements.txt to hold our dependencies. As for the database, we can use SQLite, since we&amp;rsquo;re developing only locally. The purpose of this project is to build a system that will allow us to push on a branch and deploy our changes in a separate environment, giving us a unique URL, to check them. Similarly to how &lt;a href="http://now.sh">now.sh&lt;/a> and &lt;a href="http://heorku.com">heroku.com&lt;/a> are doing. We&amp;rsquo;ll need a mechanism that will package our code and dependencies and will deploy it, but also it needs to consider multiple versions, upgrades, load-balacing, scaling and our stateful part (database).&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
